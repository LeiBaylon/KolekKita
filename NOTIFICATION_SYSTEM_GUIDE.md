# üì¢ Notification System Implementation Guide

## Overview
A comprehensive notification system has been implemented for the KolekKita Administrator Web App. This system enables administrators to send announcements to all users and automatically notifies junk shop owners when their verification requests are approved or denied.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Summary

### 1. **Notification Service** (`notificationService.js`)
Located: `client/src/services/notificationService.js`

A comprehensive Firebase Firestore service that handles all notification operations:

#### Features:
- ‚úâÔ∏è **Send single notifications** to specific users
- üì§ **Batch notifications** to multiple users simultaneously
- üì¢ **Announcements** - Create and send to all users
- ‚úÖ **Verification approved notifications** - Auto-sent when junk shop is approved
- ‚ùå **Verification denied notifications** - Auto-sent with reason when denied
- üìä **Query notifications** with filtering (by user, type, read status)
- üîÑ **Real-time updates** using React hooks

#### Key Functions:
```javascript
NotificationService.sendNotification(userId, title, message, type, data)
NotificationService.sendBatchNotifications(userIds, title, message, type, data)
NotificationService.createAnnouncement(title, message, adminId)
NotificationService.sendVerificationApprovedNotification(userId, verificationId, shopName)
NotificationService.sendVerificationDeniedNotification(userId, verificationId, reason, shopName)
NotificationService.getNotifications(filters)
NotificationService.markAsRead(notificationId)
NotificationService.deleteNotification(notificationId)
```

#### React Hooks:
```javascript
useNotifications(userId, filters) // Real-time notification listener
useAnnouncements(filters) // Real-time announcement listener
```

#### Notification Types:
- `announcement` - System-wide announcements
- `verification_approved` - Junk shop verification approved
- `verification_denied` - Junk shop verification denied
- `system` - General system notifications

## üîê Firestore Security Rules

You should update your `firestore.rules` to include:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Notifications - Users can only read their own
    match /notifications/{notificationId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                     resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
                      request.auth.token.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Announcements - Anyone can read, only admins can write
    match /announcements/{announcementId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
                      request.auth.token.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // Verifications - Updated rules
    match /verifications/{verificationId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth != null && 
                       request.auth.token.role == 'admin';
      allow delete: if request.auth != null && 
                       request.auth.token.role == 'admin';
    }

```

```
Collection: notifications
Fields: type (Ascending), createdAt (Descending)
```

```
Collection: notifications
